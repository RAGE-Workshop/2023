## Submission Instructions

The workshop follows a double-blind peer-review process. The body of each submitted paper will be limited to 6 pages of content, including the bibliography and acknowledgments. Shorter submissions are also allowed. Submissions must comply with the IEEE conference papers guidelines, i.e., 10pt font, with default line-spacing and \margins. Templates are available at IEEE templates. 
When using the LaTeX template, the document class declaration should look as follows:

```\documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran}```
