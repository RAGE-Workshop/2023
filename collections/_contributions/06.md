title: "Investigating and Mitigating Contention on Low-End Multi-Core Microcontrollers"
authors: Daniel Oliveira, Weifan Chen, Sandro Pinto and Renato Mancuso
abstract: >-
    "In this paper, we investigate the problem of contention and loss of predictability in modern microcontrollers (MCU). To address this issue, we first present a framework to empirically analyze and observe the impact of interference on low-end MCUs. With carefully crafted evaluation scenarios, we conduct experiments on an Armâ€™s Musca-A1 platform and provide sufficient evidence that even with common application setups, interference can slowdown applications by several orders of magnitude. Furthermore, we propose an architecture for a novel mitigation system that enables applications to monitor their timing progress slackness and mitigate temporal interference over shared resources. This is achieved by suspending less critical cores and reconfiguring their priority on the bus when intolerable contention delays are present. Our findings emphasize the critical importance of considering the impact of shared resources, such as interconnects and memory access patterns, on low-end multi-core MCUs. It is, therefore, crucial to design mechanisms that can allow MCU-based applications to regain control of their timeliness."
